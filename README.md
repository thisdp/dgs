# Thisdp's Dx Graphical User Interface System (MTA:SA Dx Lib)

This is a dxGUI library for [Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas](https://mtasa.com/) and is designed for the usage of dx functions.

**MTA:SA Forum Topic:** https://forum.mtasa.com/topic/95964-releasethisdps-dx-gui-system/

**Discord Topic:** https://discord.gg/QEs8q6W

All function names refer simiularly to the original MTA:SA ones. This library uses a strong property system that can freshen up your user interfaces and provides a high level of customization.

*(Sorry for the bad design of the default style though you are free to adjust everything in the colorScheme file.)*

For a full list of functions and event handlers, check the DGS wiki:

* **Arabic (عربى):** https://wiki.mtasa.com/wiki/AR/Dgs
* **Chinese:** https://wiki.mtasa.com/wiki/ZH-CN/Dgs

Auto Completion For [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) *(Thanks To Ahmed Ly)*: http://www.mediafire.com/file/m6dm7815d5dihax/lua.zip

To prevent bugs and issues with the resource, keep the resource names as **dgs**.

The reason why I released DGS is because I am ready to leave MTA. This is my one contribution to the MTA community.
Finally, I am glad to provide the DGS resource, and everyone is welcome to adjust the code and help make it better by editting the code, adding functions or events.

**Thanks for your support.**
